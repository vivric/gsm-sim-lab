  Number of Slice LUTs:                         64 out of   9,112    1%
    Number used as logic:                       64 out of   9,112    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              48
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                   16
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    21 out of   2,278    1%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of   4,556    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           71
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             4 out of      71    5%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   7 out of      71    9%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          60 out of      71   84%
    Number of unique control sets:               4
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               5 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
