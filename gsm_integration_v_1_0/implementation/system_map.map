WARNING:Place:1109 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <sc_uart_interface_modified_0_UART_CLK_pin> is placed at site
   <P11>. The corresponding BUFG component
   <sc_uart_interface_modified_0_UART_CLK_pin_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site
   <BUFGMUX_X2Y11>. There is only a select set of IOBs that can use the fast
   path to the Clocker buffer, and they are not being used. You may want to
   analyze why this problem exists and correct it. This is normally an ERROR but
   the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN
   <sc_uart_interface_modified_0_UART_CLK_pin.PAD> allowing your design to
   continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the
   specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may
   lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition
   be corrected in the design.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.

  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
